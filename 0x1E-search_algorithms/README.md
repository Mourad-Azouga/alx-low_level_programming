# Search Algorithms
## By AZOUGA Mourad
### What's a search algorithm?
        .In computer science, a search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.

### What's Space complexity?
        .The term Space Complexity is misused for Auxiliary Space at many places. Following are the correct definitions of Auxiliary Space and Space Complexity. 

        .Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.

        .The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. 

### Linear Search  
        .Works for both solved and unsolved arrays.
        .Traverses the entire array looking for the value we are searching for.

### Binary Search
        .Only works for sorted arrays.
        .Splits the array in half checks if the value is in either the right or the left side of split array, repeats the process until the value is found.
